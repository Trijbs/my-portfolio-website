# Vercel 404 Fix

## Problem
You were getting a 404 error because Vercel couldn't find your files due to incorrect routing configuration.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved Main Files to Root
- Created `index.html` in the root directory (Vercel automatically serves this)
- Created `info.html` in the root directory
- Kept the `public/` directory for assets (CSS, JS, images)

### 2. Simplified vercel.json
- Removed complex routing rules that were causing conflicts
- Kept only the essential API function configuration
- Vercel now automatically serves static files from the root

### 3. File Structure Now
```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main page (served at /)
â”œâ”€â”€ info.html              # Info page (served at /info.html)
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                # Assets directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/              # Stylesheets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/               # JavaScript files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ img/              # Images (you need to copy these)
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                  # Serverless functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contact.js        # Contact form handler
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analytics.js      # Analytics endpoint
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test-email.js     # Email testing endpoint
â””â”€â”€ vercel.json           # Simplified configuration
```

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Copy Images
Copy all images from your original `img/` directory to `public/img/`:
```bash
cp -r img/* public/img/
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard, make sure these are set:
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Your Gmail App Password

### 3. Test the Deployment
1. Deploy: `vercel --prod`
2. Visit your site - it should now load without 404 errors
3. Test email: Visit `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/test-email`
4. Test contact form: Fill out the contact form on your site

## Expected Results
- âœ… Main site loads at your domain
- âœ… Info page loads at `/info.html`
- âœ… CSS and JS files load from `/public/css/` and `/public/js/`
- âœ… API endpoints work at `/api/contact` and `/api/test-email`
- âœ… Contact form sends emails (once environment variables are set)

## Troubleshooting
If you still get 404 errors:
1. Check that `index.html` exists in the root directory
2. Make sure you've deployed the latest changes
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Check Vercel deployment logs for any build errors

The site should now work properly! ðŸŽ‰
